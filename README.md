# ccplan

A CLI tool for reviewing Claude Code plan files in an interactive TUI.
Add inline review comments to each step and send feedback back to Claude Code.

## Install

### mise

```bash
mise use -g github:koh-sh/ccplan
```

### go install

```bash
go install github.com/koh-sh/ccplan@latest
```

### Pre-built binary

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/koh-sh/ccplan/releases).

## Subcommands

### `ccplan review`

Display a plan file in a 2-pane TUI and add review comments to each step.

```bash
ccplan review path/to/plan.md

# Output review to a file
ccplan review --output file --output-path ./review.md plan.md

# Output to stdout
ccplan review --output stdout plan.md
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--output` | Output method: `clipboard` (default), `stdout`, `file` |
| `--output-path` | File path for `--output file` |
| `--theme` | Color theme: `dark` (default), `light` |
| `--track-viewed` | Persist viewed state to sidecar file (`.reviewed.json`) for change detection across sessions |

When `--track-viewed` is enabled, ccplan saves which steps you've marked as viewed in a `<plan-file>.reviewed.json` sidecar file. On subsequent runs, viewed marks are restored automatically. If a step's content has changed, its viewed mark is cleared (detected via content hash). The hook automatically enables this flag.

### `ccplan locate`

Locate plan file paths from a Claude Code transcript JSONL. This command is primarily used internally by `ccplan hook` to resolve plan file paths during hook execution.

```bash
ccplan locate --transcript ~/.claude/projects/.../session.jsonl

# List all plan files found in a transcript
ccplan locate --transcript session.jsonl --all
```

### `ccplan hook`

Run as a Claude Code PostToolUse (Write|Edit) hook. Detects writes to plan files and launches the review TUI to enable a feedback loop.

```bash
# Called automatically by Claude Code hook (no manual invocation needed)
ccplan hook
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--spawner` | Terminal multiplexer: `auto` (default), `wezterm`, `tmux` |
| `--theme` | Color theme: `dark` (default), `light` |

> **Note:** Currently only WezTerm is supported as a terminal multiplexer spawner. tmux support is not yet implemented. `auto` will try WezTerm first, then fall back to running in the same terminal.

## Claude Code Hook Setup

Add the following to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "ccplan hook",
            "timeout": 600
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook only activates in plan mode and launches the review TUI when a file under `plansDirectory` is written.

- **submitted** (exit 2): Sends review comments to Claude via stderr, prompting plan revision
- **approved / cancelled** (exit 0): Continues normally

Set `PLAN_REVIEW_SKIP=1` to temporarily disable the hook.
